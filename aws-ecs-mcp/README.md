# AWS ECS MCP Server

MCP server wrapper for [Amazon ECS](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/ecs-mcp-server) — deploy, scale, and troubleshoot containerized applications running on Amazon Elastic Container Service.

## What is Amazon ECS?

Amazon ECS is AWS's managed container orchestration service for running Docker containers on clusters of EC2 instances or AWS Fargate serverless compute. This MCP server enables AI assistants to list and describe clusters, services, and tasks; inspect task definitions and container logs; update service desired counts; and diagnose deployment failures and stopped task exit codes. See [awslabs/mcp](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/ecs-mcp-server) for full documentation.

**AWS credentials required** — set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION`.

**Summary.** MCP server wrapper for [Amazon ECS](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/ecs-mcp-server) — manage ECS clusters, services, and tasks including deployment updates and stopped-task diagnostics.

## Example Prompts

Here are example prompts you can use with Claude (or any MCP client) when this tool is connected:

- "List all ECS clusters in my account and show how many services are running in each."
- "Show me all tasks in the production cluster that stopped in the last hour and their exit codes."
- "Describe the task definition for the api-service and show the container image and environment variables."
- "Update the desired count of the web-frontend service to 6 in the production cluster."
- "Show the CloudWatch logs for the most recently stopped task in the checkout service."
- "List all ECS services across all clusters that have a deployment in progress."

## Deploy

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Run (stdio mode)

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e AWS_REGION \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  hackerdogs/aws-ecs-mcp:latest
```

### Docker Run (HTTP streamable mode)

```bash
docker run -d -p 8613:8613 \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \
  -e MCP_PORT=8613 \
  -e AWS_REGION \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  hackerdogs/aws-ecs-mcp:latest
```

## MCP Client Configuration

### Stdio mode (default)

Add to your Claude Desktop or Cursor MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-ecs-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "MCP_TRANSPORT",
        "-e",
        "AWS_REGION",
        "-e",
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
        "-e",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
        "hackerdogs/aws-ecs-mcp:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "AWS_REGION": "",
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP mode (streamable-http)

First, start the server using Docker Compose or `docker run` with HTTP mode (see [Deploy](#deploy) above), then point your MCP client at the running server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws-ecs-mcp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8613/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> **When to use HTTP mode:** HTTP mode is ideal for shared/remote deployments, multi-user setups, and [Hackerdogs](https://hackerdogs.ai) scheduled prompts. The server runs as a long-lived process and accepts connections from multiple MCP clients concurrently.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MCP_TRANSPORT` | `stdio` | Transport mode: `stdio` or `streamable-http` |
| `AWS_REGION` | — | AWS region (e.g. `us-east-1`) |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | — | AWS access key ID |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | — | AWS secret access key |
| `MCP_PORT` | `8613` | HTTP port (only used with `streamable-http`) |

## Installing in Hackerdogs

The fastest way to get started is through [Hackerdogs](https://hackerdogs.ai):

1. **Log in** to your Hackerdogs account.
2. Go to the **Tools Catalog**.
3. **Search** for the tool by name.
4. Expand the tool card and click **Install** — you're ready to go.

> Give it a couple of minutes to go live. Then start querying by asking Hackerdogs to use the tool explicitly. If you don't specify, Hackerdogs will automatically choose the best tool for the job.

5. **Vendor API key required?** Add your key in the config environment variable field before clicking Install. Your key will be encrypted at rest.
6. **Enable / Disable** the tool anytime from the **Enabled Tools** page.
7. **Need to update a key or parameter?** Go to **My Tools** → toggle **Show Decrypted Values** → edit → **Save**.

## Build

```bash
docker build -t hackerdogs/aws-ecs-mcp:latest .
```

## Testing

### Automated tests

```bash
./test.sh
```

### Test directly with Docker

**1. Start the server in HTTP mode:**

```bash
docker run -d --rm --name aws-ecs-mcp-test -p 8613:8613 \
  -e MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \
  -e AWS_REGION \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  hackerdogs/aws-ecs-mcp:latest
```

**2. Initialize the MCP session:**

```bash
SESSION_ID=$(curl -s -D - -X POST http://localhost:8613/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"0.1"}}}' \
  2>&1 | grep -i mcp-session-id | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\r\n')

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8613/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "mcp-session-id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}'
```

**3. List available tools:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8613/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "mcp-session-id: $SESSION_ID" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'
```

**4. Clean up:**

```bash
docker stop aws-ecs-mcp-test
```
