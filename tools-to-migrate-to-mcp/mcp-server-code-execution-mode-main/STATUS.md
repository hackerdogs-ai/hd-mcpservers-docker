# Project Status

## Current State

The MCP Server Code Execution Mode bridge is a **functional implementation** of the "Code Execution with MCP" pattern. It provides secure, isolated Python code execution with optional MCP server proxying. While the core functionality is complete, it requires additional operational work (testing, observability, policy controls) before production deployment.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Delivered Features

**Core Functionality:**
- Single `run_python` MCP tool exposed over stdio
- Rootless container sandbox with strict security isolation
- Host-mediated MCP server proxying into sandbox
- JSON-framed stdio transport between sandbox and host for tool calls
- Persistent MCP client sessions (avoids cold starts)
- Timeout enforcement with proper error handling
- Tool responses surface a `CallToolResult` with mirrored `structuredContent`
  and compact plain-text `TextContent`; set `MCP_BRIDGE_OUTPUT_MODE=toon` to
  emit TOON blocks when desired.
- Discovery helpers (`discovered_servers()`, `query_tool_docs()`, etc.) are
  advertised in a short sandbox summary so the LLM fetches tool metadata on
  demand instead of receiving every schema up front.
- **Persistent Memory System** for cross-session state:
  - `save_memory(key, value)` / `load_memory(key)` for data persistence
  - `update_memory(key, fn)` for atomic read-modify-write
  - `list_memories()` / `memory_exists(key)` for discovery
  - Memory stored as JSON in `/projects/memory/` (maps to `~/MCPs/user_tools/memory/`)

**Security Model:**
- Network disabled (`--network none`)
- Read-only root filesystem
- All capabilities dropped
- No new privileges enforcement
- Unprivileged user execution (65534:65534)
- Resource limits (memory, PIDs, CPU, timeout)
- Temporary workspace with tmpfs

**Performance:**
- 95%+ context reduction vs traditional MCP
- Persistent client sessions
- Efficient async execution
- Proper resource cleanup

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive README with quick start
- Detailed user guide (GUIDE.md)
- Technical architecture documentation
- Complete evolution history

### 🔄 In Progress

**Priority 1 (Operational Readiness):**
- Expand automated testing suite
  - Broaden coverage beyond existing unit tests (container command generation, discovery logic)
  - Add stress cases for RPC error handling and timeout enforcement
  - Integrate container-backed end-to-end tests (optional but recommended)

- Observability
  - Structured logging with request IDs
  - Metrics and traces for container launches, exits, errors, and tool calls
  - MCP proxy latency/failure tracking
- Agent-visible discovery channel
  - Host-proxied `mcp-find`/`mcp-add` so agents can curate servers dynamically
  - Catalog-aware policy checks before enabling newly added servers

**Priority 2 (Production Hardening):**
- Policy controls
  - Allow/deny lists for MCP servers
  - Per-request limits
  - Concurrent usage caps

- Runtime diagnostics
  - Enhanced podman/docker detection
  - Self-health checks
  - Better error messages

### 📋 Future Enhancements

**Nice to Have:**
- Connection pooling for MCP clients
- Web UI for monitoring and debugging
- Multi-language execution support
- Workflow orchestration features
- Advanced caching strategies
- Persistent and shareable code-mode artifacts that survive individual runs

## Production Readiness

### Current Status
The bridge delivers a **secure and functional** code execution environment suitable for:
- Development and testing
- Learning and experimentation
- Integration with MCP-compatible clients
- Building MCP-enabled applications

**Note:** While functional, the project explicitly avoids claiming "production-grade" status due to the operational gaps listed below.

### Before Production Deployment

Complete the **In Progress** items above, especially:
1. Automated testing - builds confidence
2. Observability - enables troubleshooting
3. Policy controls - prevents abuse

The core architecture is sound and secure, but these operational features are essential for production use.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv sync

# Run
uv run python mcp_server_code_execution_mode.py

# Register with Claude
